- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Giorgi (Giga). I am from Georgia
- ðŸ‘€ I've always loved mathematics and solving complex math problems.
- A few years ago I was first introduced to SQL and then, Python. Since then, I am certain about my passion, which is coding, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
- For me, the best way of learning is search for datasets on internet and work on them. Alternatively, I extact various textual and numerical data from online sources using Python's webscraping tools susch as Selenium and BeautifulSoup. The small sample of my webscraping project results can be found on my [Kaggle Page](http://beridzeg45.pythonanywhere.com/)<img src="https://www.kaggle.com/static/images/site-logo.svg" alt="Kaggle Logo" width="25" height="25">

- During this process I learn new formulas and techniques to solve various problems.
- The best thing I love about working with data is how numbers are converted into a story using beautiful graphs.
