- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Giorgi (Giga). I am from Georgia
- ðŸ‘€ I've always loved mathematics and solving complex math problems.
- A few years ago I was first introduced to SQL and then, Python. Since then, I am certain about my passion, which is coding, data analysis, visualization, web scraping and machine learning.
- For me, the best way of learning is search for datasets on internet and work on them. Alternatively, I extract various textual and numerical data from online sources using Python's webscraping tools susch as Selenium and BeautifulSoup. (The sample of my webscraping project results can be found on my [Kaggle Page](https://www.kaggle.com/beridzeg45/datasets)<img src="https://www.kaggle.com/static/images/site-logo.svg" alt="Kaggle Logo" width="25" height="25">)
- During this process I learn new formulas and techniques to solve various EDA and Web-Scraping problems.
- The best thing I love about working with data is how numbers are converted into a story using beautiful graphs.
