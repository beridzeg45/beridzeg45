- 👋 Hi, my name is Giga. I am from Georgia
- 👀 Since school I've always loved mathematics and solving complex math problems.
- At university I studied Business. For data analysis and visualization I used excel, which is a great tool and essential in many jobs.
- But there are also programming languages like SQL and Python which make things easier.(For example I used SQL to automate reports at my previous job and it saved a lot of time and energy)
- I wish I had known about them before, so my skills would have been on another level now.
- Every day I try to learn something new, improve my skills and build up on my current knowledge.
- For me the best way of learning is search for datasets on internet and work on them. If I come up a problem which I am not able to solve on my own I look up the similar problem and way of solving it or appeal to StackOverflow or other communities with question.
- During this process I learn new formulas, techniques and ways to solve various problems.
- First of all I want to master pandas, matplotlib, numpy. After that I want to study data scraping and machine learning.
- I will share my works on this platform and hope it will be helpful for you.
