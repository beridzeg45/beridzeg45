- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Giorgi(Giga) and I am from Georgia
- ðŸ‘€ Since school, I've always loved mathematics and solving complex math problems.
- Not a long time ago I was first introduced to SQL and then, Python. Since then, I am certain about my passion, which is coding, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.
- I wish I had known about SQL and Python before, so my skills would have been on another level now.
- Every day I try to learn something new, improve my skills and build up on my current knowledge.
- For me, the best way of learning is search for datasets on internet and work on them. Alternatively, I scrape various data from different websites.
- During this process I learn new formulas, techniques and ways to solve various problems.
- The best thing I love about working with data is how numbers are converted into a story using beautiful graphs.
